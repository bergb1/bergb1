Hi! My name is Brian van den Berg,

I'm a student at the HvA and I'm getting a bachelor degree in Computer Science.
In my free time I like to play Rhythm or Story games, but I also practise programming in my free time.
I try to keep up with the new trends in the tech industry, but right now, school is actually really busy, so finding a good balance between free, friends and school / work time is becoming a bit hard.
