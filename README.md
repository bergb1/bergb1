# Who am I?

Hello, my name is Brian van den Berg and I am the owner of this github account.

## Education

Currently I am in the third year of my four year degree in "HBO-ICT - Computer Engineering" and so far I have worked with the programming languages C, C++, Java, Python, Golang, C#, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javacript on Windows and Linux. My education is not entirely focussed on programming and I have also learned to create basic hardware interfaces for my programs. These hardware interfaces mostly const of circuit boards (created with either breadboards or prototype pcb boards) and prototype cases (created with either a 3D printer or wood).

## Interests

The fields that I am mostly interested in at the moment are Embedded, Connectivity, Security and Full-stack Development. To summarize these points under one umbrella term, I would say that I'm mostly interested in the Internet of Things.
