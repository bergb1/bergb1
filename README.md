# Who am I?

Hello, my name is Brian van den Berg and I am the owner of this github account. I was born and raised in the Netherlands, but my dream is to travel as much as possible. My hobbies besides learning and developing are music, outdoor sports and the occasional gaming. I would say that the positive traits that I am most proud of are that I am rather goal oriented self-reflective and detirmined, while the most important points that I am still working on are team-oriented planning, initiative and public speaking.

## Education

Up until the third year of my four year degree in "HBO-ICT - Computer Engineering" I had worked with the programming languages C, C++, Java, Python, Golang, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javacript on Windows and Linux. In programming we have learned about the basics, OOP, concurrency and Algorithms. Besides that, my education was not entirely focussed on programming and I have also learned to create basic hardware interfaces for my programs. These hardware interfaces mostly consisted of circuit boards (created with either breadboards or prototype pcb boards) and prototype cases (created with either a 3D printer or wood). Besides programming skills, we also learned to work with Git (during projects), Databases (MySQL), Testing and Application design (Figma).

### Projects

There have been five projects during the first two years, which are:
- Project 1
- Project 2
- Project 3
- Project 4
- Project 5

### Third year Internship

In the third year of my studies I started off by doing an internship at 'Techmedic International'. Here I learned to apply connection security in an embedded environment where a microcontroller had to communicate with a server. After finishing this internship, I can say that the most important skill I've learned from this experience, was the ability to perform in a professional environment. Working on an assignment for a company is an entirely different experience from the regular school assignment. Besides that, I would say that my C skills were severely tested and that I also became more proficient in the language in terms of using data and libraries.

### Studies abroad

Currently I'm in Finland and I have done Neural Network courses, an IT Security course and at the moment I am doing a full-stack development course with a sub-focus on the hacking and security of web applications. Besides this, I'm also doing a Finnish course.
