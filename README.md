# About Me

Currently I'm doing a degree to become an embedded software engineer, but in my spare time I also dabble in the world of back-end development and AI. In general I'm interested in all forms of software development as long as it interacts with the world and its people!

When I'm too exhausted to study in my spare time and have a moment for myself, I like to watch anime and chill.
